/*
Given two nodes in a binary tree (with parent pointer available), find their lowest common ancestor.
Assumptions
There is parent pointer for the nodes in the binary tree
The given two nodes are not guaranteed to be in the binary tree
Examples
        5
      /   \
     9     12
   /  \      \
  2    3      14
The lowest common ancestor of 2 and 14 is 5
The lowest common ancestor of 2 and 9 is 9
The lowest common ancestor of 2 and 8 is null (8 is not in the tree)
