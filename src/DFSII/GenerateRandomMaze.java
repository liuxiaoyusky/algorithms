/*
Randomly generate a maze of size N * N (where N = 2K + 1) whose corridor and wallâ€™s width are both 1 cell. For each pair of cells on the corridor, there must exist one and only one path between them. (Randomly means that the solution is generated randomly, and whenever the program is executed, the solution can be different.). The wall is denoted by 1 in the matrix and corridor is denoted by 0.

Assumptions

    N = 2K + 1 and K >= 0
    the top left corner must be corridor
    there should be as many corridor cells as possible
    for each pair of cells on the corridor, there must exist one and only one path between them

Examples

N = 5, one possible maze generated is

        0  0  0  1  0

        1  1  0  1  0

        0  1  0  0  0

        0  1  1  1  0

        0  0  0  0  0
